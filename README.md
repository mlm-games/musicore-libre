# Musicore

A MusicXML viewer for android.

Just a prototype for trying out flutter, mostly not going to develop it further due to flutter setup being a pain and automation being half-baked, and i also have an habit of resetting often.

## Features (somewhat applicable)

- displays MusicXML files (.xml, .musicxml, .mxl) (tested .mxl)
- Non-audio playback with play/pause/stop controls
- Dark mode support (only for app, )

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Place the OpenSheetMusicDisplay library in `assets/www/js/` (if not present/updating)
4. Run `flutter run`
